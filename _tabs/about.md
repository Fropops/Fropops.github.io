## Who am I

With a solid background as a C# developer spanning over 19 years, I have accumulated extensive experience in software development, leveraging the power of C# and the .NET ecosystem. Additionally, my transition to a technical project manager role has allowed me to combine my technical expertise with leadership skills, effectively guiding and coordinating teams to deliver successful projects in the ever-evolving field of technology.

My journey in cybersecurity began on the TryHackMe platform, where I embarked on hands-on challenges and interactive learning paths. This platform provided a practical and engaging environment to develop my skills in various areas.<br/>

As I progressed and honed my skills, I sought to validate my knowledge by pursuing relevant certifications. 

To further enhance my practical experience, I have now immersed myself in network labs. These labs provide a realistic and controlled environment for simulating real-world network scenarios, allowing me to explore vulnerabilities, practice exploit techniques, and refine my skills.
